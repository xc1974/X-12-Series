The last X-Series project by xc11


Hey everyone! I'm Yaison (xc11)! A student who loves exploring the internet. This project is part of a series that I've been working on for five years now.
From the closed-source XC-X and X-11 projects, this leads us to the latest initiative, the open-source X-12 Series. I understand there might be confusion about why there are no XC-X 10 or X-11 Series. This is because I chose to close-source those earlier projects entirely.
However, with the X-12 Series, we're now inviting anyone to contribute ideas and suggestions, making it an open-source initiative. I hope you find something here helpful for your project.

# X-12 Series is now collaborating with LKKC Backstage Team

The X-12 Series will primarily manage multimedia control in major events, such as singing contests and interclass performance art competitions. This includes tasks like camera control, replay management, background music setup, and lighting adjustments using RGB technology instead of traditional stage lights.
