# X-12-Series Project
The last X-Series project by xc11


Hey everyone! I’m Yasion (xc11)! A student who loves exploring the internet. This project marks my fifth year participating in it. From the XC-X 10th anniversary to the X-11 Series, this is now the X-12 Series.
I understand there might be confusion about why there’s no XC-X 10 or X-11 Series. That’s because I chose to close-source those projects entirely. However, the X-12 Series is an open-source initiative where anyone can contribute ideas and suggestions.
I hope you find something here helpful for your project.

# X-12 Series is now collaborating with LKKC Backstage Team
